# Strings

## String indices

Every string has a `.length` prop. You do not need to have parens around the `.length`. String length is also counts whitespace.

- .`length` is always one greater than the last index.
- Cannot change strings with reassignment; they are immutable.

## String methods

- Using a method on a string creates a reference to a new string; it does not mutate a string
- `.trim()` removes whitespace from leading and trailing spaces in strings
